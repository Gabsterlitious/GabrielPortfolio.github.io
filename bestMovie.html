	<h3>Why I Like This Movie</h3>
	
	<p>
	I like this movie because it is amazingly hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing throughout the whole movie! If you are looking for a quality movie, I'm sorry but this movie is not for  you. If you are looking for a rediculous movie just to make you laugh, however, this is the perfect movie to sit down with a friend and watch.

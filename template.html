	<h2 id="names">Lab Runner</h2>
		<h3>Description: Use Python to create a moving guy on the screen. He needed to respond to all 4 arrow keys and move in the corresponding direction. In addition, we also had to limit the guy to just the screen.</h3>
		<h3>Concepts Learned:
<div>Drawing- Getting the Guy to Show up on the Screen</div>
<div>Class- Create the person class with the correct image</div>
<div>While loop- While true, continue</div>
<div>Arrow keys- how to have the program recognize the keys</div>
</h3>

<h2 id="names">Wall Runner</h2>
		<h3>Description: We had to create two guys on the screen along with a wall. One guy had to be controled with the arrow keys and the other had to be controled with WASD. We needed to create boundaries, along with having the guys run into eachother and the wall.</h3>
		<h3>Concepts Learned:
<div>Draw- We learned how to draw more than one person</div>
<div>Changed Recs- We learned hoe to get the position of the other objects</div>
<div>Collide- We learned how to make the objects recognize they are hitting eachother</div>
</h3>

<h2 id="names">Ground Runner</h2>
<h3>Description: For this lab, we had to create a game with a timer. We made a guy run-using the arrow keys-after randomly appearing coins to gain points. Once you run out of time, Game ended would appear, and if the player got 10 coins before the time ran out, it would display You Win!!!</h3>
		<h3>Concepts Learned:
<div>Timer- How to use and display the timer</div>
<div>Random Variant- Make the coins pop up in random positions</div>
<div>Background- Change the background</div>
<div>Score- Variable to keep track of and display the score</div>

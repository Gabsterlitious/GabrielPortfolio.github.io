		<h2 id="names">Lab Runner</h2>
			<h3>Description: Use Python to create a moving guy on the screen. He needed to respond to all 4 arrow keys and move in the corresponding direction. In addition, we also had to limit the guy to just the screen.</h3>
			<h3>Concepts Learned:
				<div>Drawing- Getting the Guy to Show up on the Screen</div>

				<div>While loop- While true, continue</div>
				<div>Arrow keys- how to have the program recognize the keys</div>
			</h3>

		<h2 id="names">Wall Runner</h2>
			<h3>Description: We had to create two guys on the screen along with a wall. One guy had to be controled with the arrow keys and the other had to be controled with WASD. We needed to create boundaries, along with having the guys run into eachother and the wall.</h3>
			<h3>Concepts Learned:
				<div>Draw- We learned how to draw more than one person</div>
				<div>Changed Recs- We learned hoe to get the position of the other objects</div>
				<div>Collide- We learned how to make the objects recognize they are hitting eachother</div>
			</h3>

		<h2 id="names">Ground Runner</h2>
			<h3>Description: For this lab, we had to create a game with a timer. We made a guy run-using the arrow keys-after randomly appearing coins to gain points. Once you run out of time, Game ended would appear, and if the player got 10 coins before the time ran out, it would display You Win!!!</h3>
			<h3>Concepts Learned:
				<div>Timer- How to use and display the timer</div>
				<div>Random Variant- Make the coins pop up in random positions</div>
				<div>Background- Change the background</div>
				<div>Score- Variable to keep track of and display the score</div>
	
		<h2 id="names">Dodge Runner</h2>
			<h3>Description: For this game, we had to make a game where you had to cross the road with your guy. You just control him with the arrow keys, but the tricky part was that there were aliens crossing. The game got a lot harder every level and it eventually became extremely difficult.</h3>
			<h3>Concepts Learned:
				<div>Speed- How to change the speed of the aliens</div>
				<div>Random Variant- Make the aliens come at random places</div>
				<div>Game Win and Game End</div>
			</h3>
		
		<h2 id="names">Final Project</h2>
			<h3>Description: For this game, we had to make our own game using the resources we had. I made a game that when you click the spacebar, the soccerball would jump up, and it would fall otherwise. You had to try to get the ball into the goal and it had 3 different levels as you went.</h3>
			<h3>Concepts Learned:
				<div>Background- How to make a moving background</div>
				<div>Levels- How to change levels</div>
				<div>Title Page- how to make a title page</div>
				<div>Movement- How to make the ball keep going down unless you hit the spacebar</div>
				<div>Sound- How to get music in the game</div>

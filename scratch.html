		<h3>Description: Use scratch to create a cool animation with the letters of our name and to have a cool animation going on in the background at the same time. There had to be at least three different animations.The program ran when the green flag was clicked and it also reset each time.</h3>
		<h3>Concepts Learned:
<div>Using event blocks- Green flag clicked</div>
<div>Loops- Forever block to make it keep going</div>
<div>Sprites- Created my own sprites</div>

</h3>

<h2 id="names">Computer Buying Project</h2>
		<h3>Description: We had to create a game or a story for other people in the class to play. I chose to go with a game, and the requirements for that was that it needed a help page, it needed to get harder as you go on, and it needed a timer. The program had to restart when you clicked the green flag and the points had to reset.</h3>
		<h3>Concepts Learned:
<div>Background- We changed the background every slide</div>
<div>Loops- We used if statements to change the slides</div>
<div>Event- If A is clicked, change slides</div>
<div>Presentation skills</div>
</h3>

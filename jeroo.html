		<h2 id="names">Unit 1</h2>
		<h3>Description: Use Jeroo to learn the basics of Java-based programs. We had labs to complete that gave us the tools we needed to find out how to make the Jeroo do basic movements and actions to reach a goal. For this lab, we had to learn to make the Jeroo go around in a diamond shape and plant flowers as it went. In the end, the jeroo needed to end at the same place it began.</h3>
		<h3>Concepts Learned:
<div>Action Methods- We needed to make the Jeroo hop and plant</div>
<div>Relative Direction- We needed to make the Jeroo turn</div>
<div>Instalation- We learned how to place a Jeroo with certain conditions</div>
<div>Method Main- This is where we wrote the code</div>
</h3>

		<h2 id="names">Unit 2</h2>
		<h3>Description: Use the labs to learn how to use methods. For this lab, we needed to write a method and have all 4 Jeroos break out from the center and end at seperate goals. The tricky part was that they all had to use the same method, so the method had to be universal to all the Jeroos.</h3>
		<h3>Concepts Learned:
<div>Calling Methods- We needed to make the Jeroo run the method</div>
<div>Naming Methods- We learned how to name seperate methods</div>
<div>Why we Have Methods- We saw that methods are very useful when you are repeating something</div>
</h3>

		<h2 id="names">Unit 3</h2>
		<h3>Description: Use the labs to learn how to use while loops. For this lab, we had to make the Jeroo go forward until there was water in front. Then we had to make the Jeroo turn, and it had to comtinue that process until it was facing a flower.</h3>
		<h3>Concepts Learned:
<div>While Loops- As long as this is true, do an action</div>
<div>Boolean Methods- Is the Jeroo facing water?</div>
<div>Conditions- Is it true? Is it false?</div>
<div>When to Use While Loops- If you want a code to repeat until the statement is false</div>
</h3>

		<h2 id="names">Unit 4</h2>
		<h3>Description: Use the labs to learn how to use if statements. For this lab, we had to follow strict directions and create our own if statements to follow the rules. The hard part on this lab was to get it to stop at the specific flower. It was difficult to make the conditions for the while loop and it was also hard to keep track of all the if statements. For this one, we couldn't do it your own way.</h3>
		<h3>Concepts Learned:
<div>if statements- if this is true, do an action. Check this first</div>
<div>else if statements- if this is true, do an action. Check this after the if statement</div>
<div>else- if the if and else if statements don't apply, do this.</div>
<div>When to Use if Statements- If you want a code to check if a certain condition is true at that time.</div>
</h3>

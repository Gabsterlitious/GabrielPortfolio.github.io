			<p style="color:#00004d;">
			I like this movie because it is amazingly hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing throughout the whole movie! If you are looking for a quality movie, I'm sorry but this movie is not for  you. If you are looking for a rediculous movie just to make you laugh, however, this is the perfect movie to sit down with a friend and watch.

		<h3 style="color:#00004d;">My Favorite Actor</h3>
			<p style="color:#00004d;">
			My favorite actor is Lau Kar-wing because he stays in character throughout the whole movie. He acts as Wimp Lo, who, as implied, is quite whimpy. He is very funny and stays very serious throughout the whole movie, which is quite hard when you are given such a funny role.

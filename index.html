	<h2>All About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Gabi! Ever since I was small, I loved playing soccer. I used it as a way to get all my energy out of my body. My parents, both being scientists, always encouraged me to do what I loved, and as I grew up, I found that I loved engineering. It was always so fun to build something up yourself and see the final product. That is why I have decided I would like to become an engineer when I grow up. Although I love soccer, engineering is a practical job, and I enjoy it just as much.</p>
